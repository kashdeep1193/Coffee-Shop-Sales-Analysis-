** Project Description**

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of a Coffee Shop’s sales performance across multiple dimensions, including time of day, location, product categories, and order sizes. Designed as an interactive dashboard, this visualization provides a bird's-eye view of key business metrics, helping stakeholders and decision-makers gain actionable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and operational patterns.
Using business intelligence techniques and advanced Excel dashboarding, the analysis tracks total sales, transaction volume, popular products, store-wise performance, and ordering patterns. The goal is to support better planning in inventory management, marketing efforts, and staffing schedules while maximizing revenue opportunities and customer satisfaction.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
•	Total Sales: The coffee shop chain recorded a revenue of $698,812.33, reflecting strong performance over the analysis period.
•	Total Transactions: A total of 149,116 transactions were processed, indicating high customer engagement and footfall.
•	Average Bill per Person: Customers spent an average of $4.69, which can serve as a benchmark for evaluating promotional effectiveness.
•	Average Orders per Person: On average, each customer placed 1.44 orders, offering insight into buying frequency.

Orders by Hour & Day
•	The highest number of orders occurred between 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM, peaking around breakfast hours—showing that the coffee shop thrives in the early morning rush.
•	After 10:00 AM, a steady decline is observed, with order volumes significantly dropping post 12 PM.
•	This insight can help optimize staffing and supply during the morning hours when demand is at its peak.
Orders by Day of the Week
•	Friday had the highest order volume (21,701 orders), followed closely by Thursday and Monday.
•	Saturday witnessed the lowest number of orders (20,510), which may indicate customer behavior changes on weekends or reduced footfall.
This weekday trend can help in planning marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and store operations tailored to peak days.
Sales Distribution by Category
The pie chart illustrating Total Sales Category Wise reveals the following:
•	Drinking Chocolate and Flavours dominate with 39% and 28% of total sales, respectively.
•	Coffee contributes only 10%, suggesting potential for product repositioning or promotional efforts.
•	Other categories like Bakery, Loose Tea, and Packaged Chocolate have marginal sales (1–2%).
This insight highlights which categories are driving revenue and which need attention in terms of product development or marketing.
Order Sizes
•	Regular, Large, and Not Defined sizes are almost evenly distributed at ~30% each.
•	Small sizes account for only 9%, which might indicate a customer preference for more value or volume-based offerings.

The data could be used to reconfigure pricing or promotions for different cup sizes to influence upselling or reduce ambiguity in undefined orders.
Location-Based Analysis
The Footfall & Sales Over Store Locations chart compares three branches:
•	Hell’s Kitchen recorded the highest revenue at $236,511.17, followed by Astoria and Lower Manhattan.
•	Astoria had slightly fewer transactions but similar revenue, implying a higher average order value.
•	Lower Manhattan had the lowest footfall and sales, possibly pointing to lower customer density or location-based limitations.

These insights are critical for local store managers and for considering expansion or location-based advertising.
Top Products Driving Revenue
The Top 5 Sold Products Based on Revenue were:
1.	Barista Espresso – $91,406.20
2.	Brewed Chai Tea – $77,081.95
3.	Gourmet Brewed Coffee – $70,034.60
4.	Hot Chocolate – $72,416.00
5.	Brewed Black Tea – $47,932.00

Barista Espresso was the highest-grossing item, emphasizing its flagship status. These insights can guide inventory stocking, promotional campaigns, and bundling offers.
Conclusion
This dashboard presents a well-rounded view of a coffee shop chain’s sales performance, highlighting customer preferences, temporal trends, store-level contributions, and product popularity. These insights are invaluable for:
•	Inventory Management – stock top-selling items based on revenue patterns
•	Marketing Strategy – target days or hours with lower footfall
•	Menu Optimization – focus on expanding popular categories like Drinking Chocolate and Flavours
•	Operational Efficiency – align staffing with morning rush and high-traffic weekdays**
